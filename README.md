### Large Scale Streaming Data in Limavady

The slides (in PDF format) are from my talk about Kafka, Kinesis, Onyx, Kafka Streams and the story of how a project of large volumes of data went from success to failure to success. 

For info on all of this and more feel free to have a read of my blog: [Data Is Sexy](http://dataissexy.wordpress.com)

Many thanks to the conference organisers and all at @skillsmatter for making me feel welcome and supported during the day.
